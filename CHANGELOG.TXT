CHANGELOG:

v5.1.1:
    - Fix the error that caused RaccoonLock not to run on Ubuntu 24.04.
    - Fix the error that made it impossible for RaccoonLock to find RaccoonReader when
    running outside the app's working directory.

v5.1.0:
    - Ask for password change when updating data file if old password had a length of 
    less than 8 characters.

v5.0.0:
    - Re-licensed RaccoonLock and RaccoonReader to the GNU GPL v3.
    - Fixed the critical security bug that made RaccoonReader able to decrypt information without
    the password.
    - Added more services.
    - Added 'Change Password' section.
    - Fixed some translations.
    - Created new format `.rld`, previously used for error dumps, now more secure and reliable
    for storing encrypted information with RaccoonReader.
    - Separated encrypted from unencrypted information into two different files.
    - Rebuilt backup algorithms so they now work with GNU tar.
    - Fixed and refactored the major part of the mess the whole codebase used to be.
    - Removed 2FA since nobody used it (and I accidentally leaked the API key for the Google e-mail account).
