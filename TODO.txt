Current TODOs:
- Implement main screen.
- Implement the welcome screen for new users.
- Find a less painful way to include translations.
- Figure out how to include a light/dark mode.

MAIN SCREEN:
Buttons: Password generator, password manager, settings.

PASSWORD MANAGER:
Show the passwords directly, add an "add password" button and each service will have its own button.
After selecting a service, show another screen with the passwords for that service.
