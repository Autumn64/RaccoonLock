## A free, open-source, simple and powerful password manager.

### Description
RaccoonLock is a multi-platform password manager coded in Electron and C, made with the purpose of providing a lightweight, straightforward and secure password manager for PC users who want to store their passwords in a safe way totally offline.

### Contribution Guidelines
We are not currently accepting contributions as we're rewriting large chunks of code. We'll publish appropriate contribution guidelines soon.

### Features
- Multi-platform.
- Uses AES-256 encryption algorithms to protect your passwords through [GNU Privacy Guard](https://gnupg.org/).
- Includes a powerful random password generator.

### How to compile manually
- All the dependencies required for Electron are already defined in the `package.json` file, so it should work just by running `npm install` and then `npm start`. Make sure you also have GPG installed in your system.
