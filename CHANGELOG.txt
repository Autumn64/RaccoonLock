WARNING: If you are currently using RaccoonLock v2.0.0, please download "Raccoon_v2tov3.exe" from RaccoonLock's GitHub repository and run it before updating to version v3.0.0 (antivirus softwares might show a malware warning; it's a false positive. If you have any questions related to how this utility works, please refer to the source code provided in RaccoonLock's GitHub repository).

If you're using RaccoonLock v1.0.0, please manually upgrade to v2.0.0 before running "Raccoon_v2tov3.exe". You might have to manually readd all of your passwords due to the difference in how v1.0.0 and v2.0.0 read the user's data.
